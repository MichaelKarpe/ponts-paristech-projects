# Text matching from different languages without prior knowledge

This project has been realized in December 2017 and January 2018, during my second year at *École des Ponts ParisTech* in _Applied Mathematics and Computer Science_. This project was associated to a course called _Advanced programming and algorithms_.

The goal of this project was to implement dynamic programming techniques described in the following paper _(in French only)_:

**Kim Gerdes. L'alignement pour les pauvres : Adapter la bonne métrique pour un algorithme dynamique de dilatation temporelle pour l'alignement sans ressources de corpus bilingues. JADT, 2008, France. pp.527-538, 2008. 〈halshs-00685082〉** : https://gerdes.fr/papiers/2008/alignementPauvres.pdf

Considering time constraints, this project has been left uncleaned. The assignment for validation of this project was to produce a poster explaining clearly concepts and techniques described in the above paper, to show our understanding of these notions. This poster is available in the `doc` file _(in French only)_.
