# Markovian image restoration

This project has been realized in April and May 2017, during my first year at *Ã‰cole des Ponts ParisTech*. This project was an _Initiation to research Project_. We decided to work on image restoration using Markow Random Fields, a notion we had not seen during the first year.

The goal of this project was to understand what are Markov Random Fields and how to use them for image restoration. I implemented algorithms in C++ which are able to restore noisy simple images, using Markov Random Fields, Gibbs potential or Simulated Annealing.

The final report of the project and the slides shown for the presentation are available in the `doc` file.
