# Simplified Zuma

This project has been realized in May and June 2017, during my first year at *Ã‰cole des Ponts ParisTech*. This project was associated to a course called _Programming Workshop_.

The goal of this _Programming Workshop_ was to code a little game, using notions of C++ learned during the course _Introduction to programming_. We tried to reproduce a simplified *Zuma*, but this has been a little too ambitious for a project timed for around 20 hrs!

Considering time constraints, this project has been left uncleaned and probably unstable. The aim of this code was above all to show to the teacher our understanding of the notions of C++ learned during his _Introduction to Programming_.
