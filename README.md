# Perfect trajectory forecasts in billiards

This project has been realized from June 2015 to June 2016, during the end of my first year and my second year in _Classe Préparatoire_, for an exam called "Personal Initiative Workshop" _(Travail d'Initiative Personnelle Encadré - TIPE)_.

As I had at this time very few knowledge in Python, I have totally remade the code in June and July 2018 to make it readable for anyone. This has been possible thanks to knowledge developed during my second year at *École des Ponts ParisTech* in _Applied Mathematics and Computer Science_, particularly thanks to the course _Software design and development_ from Xavier Clerc.

Some documentation written in 2016 _(in French only)_ is available to understand the physical and geometric approaches used to develop a code which is able to compute perfect trajectories to win at billiard (under some conditions...)!
